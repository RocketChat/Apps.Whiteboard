## Local Setup Guide

### Join our app's community from [here](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/white-board-integration-team) üíªüßë‚Äçü§ù‚ÄçüßëüöÄ.

#### Make sure you have a working Rocket.Chat server and Apps-Engine CLI for your machine. You can setup the server for your local machine from [here](https://developer.rocket.chat/open-source-projects/server/server-environment-setup) and CLI from [here](https://developer.rocket.chat/apps-engine/getting-started/rocket.chat-app-engine-cli).

1. Navigate to the `client` folder:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install all required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the webpack bundle for the Excalidraw React app:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Execute the build.js script to generate build scripts for `excalidraw.ts` and `excalidrawContent.ts`:

   ```bash
   npm run build:excalidraw
   ```

5. Change directory to `whiteboard` and install all Rocket chat app packages :
   ```bash
   cd ../whiteboard/
   ```
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
6. Deploy your app locally

   ```bash
   rc-apps deploy --url http://localhost:3000 --username ${username} --password ${password}
   ```

   Your username and password are your local server's user credentials .Verify the successful build by accessing the `/excalidraw` endpoint in the Whiteboard app settings. You can access the React app through the provided URL.

### Instead of running the above commands, you can simply use the shortcut commands

1. #### Run the following command within the `Apps.Whiteboard` folder

   ```bash
   cd client \
   && npm install \
   && npm run build \
   && npm run build:excalidraw \
   && cd ../whiteboard/ \
   && npm install \
   && rc-apps deploy --url http://localhost:3000 --username ${username} --password ${password}

   ```

   Make sure to replace ${username} and ${password} with the actual username and password values of your local server's user credentials

2. #### You can use the Makefile to run the server as well

   ```bash
   make YOUR_USERNAME=${username} YOUR_PASSWORD=${password}
   ```

   Make sure to replace ${username} and ${password} with the actual username and password values of your local server's user credentials. Alternatively, you can modify the Makefile directly by replacing the USERNAME and PASSWORD variables.

   #### Additional Commands:

   For build:

   ```bash
   make build YOUR_USERNAME=${username} YOUR_PASSWORD=${password}
   ```

   For deploy:

   ```bash
   make deploy YOUR_USERNAME=${username} YOUR_PASSWORD=${password}
   ```
